,,"Country sizes show **actual land area**. Most world maps don't show this accurately as it isn't possible to represent the globe as a flat map without compromising on either shape or area.","Country sizes show **total population** – which includes all residents except refugees. Asia balloons enormously, emphasising that more than half of the world's people live there.","Country sizes show **total GDP**, the sum of all the economic activity in each nation. The map is dominated by North America and Western Europe, which account for more than half the world's GDP, despite being home to less than a fifth of the global population.","Country sizes show the eventual **CO₂ emissions from oil, coal and gas extracted** each year. Many of these fuels are exported rather than used domestically, but arguably the countries extracting and selling fossil fuels bear a degree of responsibility for the resulting emissions.","Countries are sized to show their annual **CO₂ emissions from fossil fuel use** and cement production. This is the conventional way to view national emissions, but it ignores imports and exports of fossil fuels (the [Extraction map](#Extraction)) and goods and services (the [Consumption](#Consumption) map).","Country sizes show the **carbon footprint of all goods and services consumed** in a nation, including imports and excluding exports. Compared to the [Emissions map](#Emissions), major exporters such as China shrink, while net importers such as the UK grow.
","Country sizes show **CO₂ emissions from energy use 1850–2007**. These historical (or 'cumulative') emissions remain relevant because CO₂ can remain in the air for centuries. Europe and the US dominate, having released around half the CO₂ ever emitted.","Country sizes show the **potential CO2 emissions of fossil fuel reserves**, calculated by converting each nation's estimated stocks of economically recoverable oil, coal and gas into the CO2 that result if all those fuels were burned. 
","Country sizes show the number of **people injured, left homeless, displaced or requiring emergency assistance due to floods, droughts or extreme temperatures** in a typical year. Climate change is expected to exacerbate many of these threats.","Country sizes show the number of **people living less than 5m above sea level**. Some low-lying populations will find themselves exposed to rising sea levels in the coming decades and centuries.","Country sizes show the number of **people living on less than 1.25 dollars a day**. Poverty adds to climate change vulnerability because lack of access to health services increases the risks of climatic changes, and lack of access to capital makes it harder to implement adaptation measures."
