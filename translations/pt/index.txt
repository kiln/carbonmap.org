Carbon map-00.mp3 We're used to seeing the world like this – though if countries are resized to represent their true area, it actually looks more like this.

Carbon map-01.mp3  But area is only one way of looking at the world. This site gives some others, such as where the people are …

… and where the money is.

Carbon map-02.mp3 Mainly, though, this site is about climate change. Browse the Responsibility maps to see how each country helps drive global carbon emissions,

Carbon map-03.mp3 from extracting fossil fuels …

Carbon map-04.mp3 … and burning them

Carbon map-06.mp3 You can also see historical emissions – most of which are still in the air …

Carbon map-08.mp3 In addition, you’ll find some Vulnerability maps, which show the people most at risk from climate change – such as those already exposed to droughts, floods and extreme temperatures.

Carbon map-09.mp3 Click on a country to see its national data. And, if you like, use the shading dropdown to overlay extra information.

Carbon map-10.mp3 For example, we can add shading to show where population is rising – the red areas – or falling – the green areas:

Carbon map-11.mp3 If we then click the emissions map…

… we can see that the countries with the fastest-growing populations currently release very little CO2.

Carbon map-12.mp3 But click to the People At Risk map:

… and we can see that those same booming populations are very exposed to climate change impacts.

Carbon map-13.mp3 So that's the Carbon Map. Click around to get a better handle on this crucial but complex topic.
