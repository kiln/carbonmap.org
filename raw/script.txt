Welcome to the Carbon Map.

We're used to seeing the world like this – though if countries are resized to show their true area, it actually looks more like this.
* Area

But area is only one way of looking at the world. This site gives some others, such as where the people are …
* Population

… and where the money is.
* Wealth

Mainly, though, this site is about climate change. It shows how each country drive global carbon emissions, from extracting fossil fuels …
* Extraction

… and burning them
* Emissions 

… to consuming the goods and services that result.
* Consumption

It also shows historical emissions – most of which are still in the air …
* Historical

… and potential emissions currently locked up in coal, oil and gas reserves
* Reserves

In addition, the site shows which people are most at risk from climate change – such as those exposed to droughts, floods and extreme temperatures.
* PeopleAtRisk

You can click on a country to see its national data.

And use the shading feature to overlay extra information.  For example, we can add shading to show where the population is rising – the red areas – or falling – the green areas:
* Apply population shading

If we then click the emissions map…
* Emissions map

… we can see that the countries with the fastest-growing populations currently release almost zero CO2. But click to the People At Risk map:
* People At Risk map

… and we can see that those same booming populations are very exposed to climate change impacts.

So that's the Carbon Map. Click around to get a better handle on this crucial but complex topic.
